Installation
============

0. We support ``Linux`` and ``Windows`` platforms, ``Python 3.6`` and ``Python  3.7``
    * ``Python 3.5`` is not supported!
    * installation for ``Windows`` requires ``Git`` for Windows (for example, `git <https://git-scm.com/download/win>`__ ), ``Visual Studio 2015/2017`` with ``C++`` build tools installed!

1. Create a virtual environment:

    .. code:: bash

        python -m venv env

2. Activate the environment:

    * Linux

        .. code:: bash

            source ./env/bin/activate

    * Windows

        .. code:: bash

            .\env\Scripts\activate.bat

3. Install the package inside this virtual environment:

    .. code:: bash
